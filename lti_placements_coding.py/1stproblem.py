# Johnny was absent in his english class when the vowel topic was taught by the teacher . 
# His english teacher gave him two strings and told him to find the length 
# of the longest common subsequence which contains only vowels, as a punishment 
# for not attending english class yesterday .

# Help Jhonny by writing a code to find the length of the longest common subsequence 

# Input Specification:

# input1: First string given by his teacher
# input2: Second string given by his teacher.
# Output Specification:

# Return the length of the longest common subsequence which contains only vowels.
# Example 1:

# vowelpunish

# english

# Output : 2
